I am interested in environmental remediation: pollution modeling and the data analysis that comes with that are my jam. I also think that the tools we are learning in this class are useful in the corporate setting -- performance metrics, etc. could all be run through tools like this.

I also have a [blog](www.elisewall.com) where I post projects and classwork I'm particularly passionate about.

But for practice, I thought I would tell you a little bit about Bill Murray!

**How Bill Murray's Part Affects Box Office Profits**

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
col1 = c("Leading Actor", "Supporting Actor", "Cameo")
col2 = c(964264090, 671063320, 321027122)
col3 = c(24, 16, 5)
df=data.frame(col1, col2, col3)
colnames(df) = c("Bill Murray's Role", "Domestic Box Office (US dollars)", "Number of Movies")

df

```

Creating code that pushes graphs reflecting up-to-date datasets without doing more than clicking a button resonates deeply with me. Bring on the pretty graphs!

So far our group is only working with data samples given in RStudio, but as we evolve this quarter I'm excited to see what we dig up!

Note: Unsure how to make the following chunk run without showing its results.
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
# setwd('students')
```

####How does using read_csv from the readr package improve data readability?

Using read.csv (the default) is pretty messy and unhelpful

```{r}
d = read.csv('./data/sparrow925_EUSO2.csv')
head(d)
summary(d)
```

Compare that to using read_csv, which gives you usefull info!

```{r}
# Oh man the head and summary here are so much more usable
d2 = read_csv('./data/sparrow925_EUSO2.csv')
head(d2)
summary(d2)
```

Now, lets use dplyr.
Let's ask ourselves, how many cities are measured for each country?

#### Using Multiple Variables

```{r}
# read in csv
d = read_csv('./data/sparrow925_EUSO2.csv')
# view data
#head(d)
#summary(d)
# limit columns to country and city
d2=d[,c('country_code','city_name')]
# get count per country
d3=aggregate(city_name ~ country_code, data=d2, FUN='length')
# write out csv
write.csv(d3, './data/sparrow925_EUSO2_citycount.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

#### Using dplyr to Write Compact Code

```{r}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
setwd('students')

# read in csv
sparrow925_EUSO2_dplyr = read_csv('./data/sparrow925_EUSO2.csv')
sparrow925_EUSO2_dplyr %T>%
  glimpse() %>% # view 
  select(country_code, city_name) %>% # limit columns
  group_by(city_name) %>% # get count by grouping
  summarize(n=n()) %>% # then summarize
  write.csv('./data/sparrow925_EUSO2_citycount.csv')
```
