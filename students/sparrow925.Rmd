I am interested in environmental remediation: pollution modeling and the data analysis that comes with that are my jam. I also think that the tools we are learning in this class are useful in the corporate setting -- performance metrics, etc. could all be run through tools like this.

I also have a [blog](www.elisewall.com) where I post projects and classwork I'm particularly passionate about.

But for practice, I thought I would tell you a little bit about Bill Murray!

**How Bill Murray's Part Affects Box Office Profits**

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
col1 = c("Leading Actor", "Supporting Actor", "Cameo")
col2 = c(964264090, 671063320, 321027122)
col3 = c(24, 16, 5)
df=data.frame(col1, col2, col3)
colnames(df) = c("Bill Murray's Role", "Domestic Box Office (US dollars)", "Number of Movies")

df

```

Creating code that pushes graphs reflecting up-to-date datasets without doing more than clicking a button resonates deeply with me. Bring on the pretty graphs!

So far our group is only working with data samples given in RStudio, but as we evolve this quarter I'm excited to see what we dig up!
