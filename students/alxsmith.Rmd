## Data

Still deciding on which data to use. Below is sample data which includes:

* Fisherman indicator (fisherman=1)
* Age (yrs)
* Residence time (yrs)
* Height (cm)
* Weight (kg)
* Fish meals per week
* Parts of fish consumed:
   0=none, 1=mussle tissure, 2= sometimes whole fish, 3= whole fish
* Methyl Mercury (mg/g)
* Total Mercury (mg/g)

```{r}
#read csv
data = read.csv("data/alxsmith_fishermen.csv")

#output summary 
summary(data)
```

Here's a sample plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fishfactor=factor(data$fishpart, levels = c(0,1,2,3), labels=c("No Fish", "Mussle Tissue", "Whole Fish\n(sometimes)", "Whole Fish"))
plot(fishfactor, pch=15, col=rainbow(4), main="Fish Part Consumption")
```
