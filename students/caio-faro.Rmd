## *Content*
  
  I'm interested in fishery management and ocean conservation, particulary related to ecologically sensitive species such as **sharks and rays**.
  Currently I'm working in the [Fisheries Management](https://github.com/fishmgt) group for the Informatics course at the Master of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB.

## *Techniques*
        
  I hope to take from the Informatics course skills like how use the github plataform, that allows a collaborative workspace, and how to organize and manage data. Also, I think improving my R skills, especially in generating better visualitions of data, might be a differential in my future professional life.
        
## *Data*
        
  At the present moment I'm not participating in any MESM project. However, when searching for a opportunity to write my proposal I looked at The International Comission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) database on shark captures, which I'll be using for this assignment.
  
  
```{r}
# read csv
d = read.csv('data/caio-faro_ICCATSharks.csv')
Brazil <- subset(d, PartyName == "BRAZIL")
      
# output summary
summary(Brazil)
```
